ETF Investment Holdings Web Scraper
This project is a web scraping exercise that extracts investment holdings from various exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and organizes the data into a structured pandas DataFrame. The goal is to scrape ticker symbols (e.g., AAPL, NVDA) and their allocation weights, then format the data as floating-point values by removing percentage symbols.

Features

- ‚úÖ Ensure all allocation weights are in float format for further analysis

Example DataFrame Structure
